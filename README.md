## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my gitHub page.  
Most of my repositories are private but I'm working on a couple of portfolio projects to showcase some of my skill.  
Circle back when you get the chance to catch my updates.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about embedded systems hardware and software
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: drop me a line at my [page](www.omgitskillah.com)
- âš¡ Fun fact: Samuel Morse, the inventor of the Morse code, was a painter as well. One of his portraits is of the first governor of Arkansas and hangs in the governorâ€™s mansion of that state. I paint too (sometimes). Coincidence? I think not!! ðŸ˜„
